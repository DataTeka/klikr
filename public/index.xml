      <description>Since returning to Belgrade early this year, Tatjana has been actively involved in promoting R for Data Science here in Serbia. Her love for teaching and the empowerment of people with knowledge for data analysis through the use of R is obvious. Through her active engagements with the local data science community initiatives such as R-Ladies Belgrade, Tatjana encourages a creative and open approach to teaching and learning and is a great advocate of diversity within the R community and STEM in general.</description>

Using our smart mobile phones with sensor platforms or simply scanning bankcards at store checkouts, we generate vast amounts of data on a daily basis. The potential commercial value of collectable and analysed data is vast, it offers an insight into the minds of millions of consumers and innovative and energetic businesses have been quick to capitalise on this new reality.</description>
