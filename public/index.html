<meta property="description" content="Story telling is a great skill, craft or even an art. Irrespective of who you are and what you do, the ability to communicate ideas and narratives require imagination and creativity, but shaping these elements into an absorbing story requires skill. Of course, every story requires information, something, from which we can use our imaginations to formulate ideas, characters and the environment in which they exist. By substituting the word ‘data’ for the word ‘information’, it is possible to gain a more tangible insight into the world of the data scientist.With the current ubiquitous use of smart technologies and accompanying use of social media, satellite navigation and myriad of applications available, there is a corresponding rise in big and complex data (information). As a consequence, the stories that can be told using this information (data) is infinite and requires a level of understanding and skill to identify what the stories are and how to tell them to most listeners. This is the day-to-day vocation of a data scientist, we choose the data that we need to tell stories, but also to answer questions and develop ideas that shape imaginations. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We will use R language to turn statistics within the data into a story that people can understand and use to solve a problems that are of concern to them or project ideas that are potentially life changing. Why R? Because R is the most sophisticated data analysis programming language, quickly becoming the tool of choice for many data scientists as it enables easy experimentation and exploration of data, reflecting and mirroring the way in which you consider a particular problem. R amalgamates the learning of important and desirable skills of the XXI century kids: code writing for statistical modelling and visualisation and data reporting in a reproducible manner. Through a series of demonstrations and hands on exercises you will learn some of the fundamental concepts of R and you will get to know how to use the tools needed in a typical data science project. You will be introduced to graphical and numerical techniques for exploring the information concealed within a dataset. After you develop an understanding of your data you will use R’s reproducible and interactive approach to knit this into a tight and concise narrative and of course, present your story by creating reproducible R-Markdown documents and Shiny Web Apps.">

        <h2><p style="margin: 20px"; padding: 20px; align="justify"> Klik-R is an initiative designed to introduce and make accessible the state of the art world of data science and is a key component of the <a href=https://datateka.com>DataTeka</a> portfolio. 
        The  Klik-R workshop focusses on developing an understanding of the story telling role of data science. We do this by introducing open data sources to students and facilitating the understanding of complex data in an uncomplicated manner by highlighting the hidden storylines within data. 
        <br><br> In this workshop, we will use R language to turn statistics within the data into a story that people can understand and use to solve problems that are of concern to them or project ideas that are potentially life changing. Why R? Because R is the most sophisticated data analysis programming language, 
        quickly becoming the tool of choice for many data scientists, as it enables easy experimentation and exploration of data, reflecting and mirroring the way in which you consider a particular problem. 
        R amalgamates the learning of important and desirable skills of XXI century kids: code writing for statistical modelling and visualisation and data reporting in a reproducible manner. 
        Through a series of demonstrations and hands on exercises you will learn some of the fundamental concepts of R and you will get to know how to use the tools needed in a typical data science project. You will be introduced to graphical and numerical techniques for exploring the information concealed within a dataset. 
        After you develop an understanding of your data you will use R’s reproducible and interactive approach to knit this into a tight and concise narrative and of course, present your story by creating reproducible R-Markdown documents and Shiny Web Apps. 
        <br><br>Workshop delivery will be in English and Serbian!
        <br><br>The instructor is Dr. Tatjana Kecojević who is a longtime R user with a doctorate in Statistics from the University of Manchester. 
        She has spent many years working in U.K. higher education as a Senior Lecturer and has a comprehensive research record in area of quantile regression. 
        She is a cofounder of <a href=https://datateka.com>DataTeka</a> a company dedicated to helping people better understand and make sense of their data through insightful training strategies. 
        She is a founder and co-organiser of <a href=https://rladies.org>R-Ladies</a> Manchester and Belgrade chapters and a team leader in the <a href=https://forwards.github.io>R Forwards</a> taskforce that aim to widen the participation of women and other under-represented groups in the R Community and wider Data Science field. 
        Her interests lie in the field of statistical modelling, statistical computing, statistical computer education and everything related to #rstats. More about Tatjana and what she does can be found at the website: <a href=https://tanjakec.github.io>tanjakec.github.io</a>
