      <description>The klik-R workshop couldn‚Äôt have got to a better start! üòÉ
‚ÄúI learned something new.‚Äù
 Our students were amazing; they were all fired up, bursting with enthusiasm and a desire to learn about R-stats. If this is level of interest at our first workshop what will the next one be like? We‚Äôre super exited!!
What we learned from workshop:
 Not everyone owns a laptop, so we need to source more equipment to make the sessions more inclusive.</description>

      <description>Since returning to Belgrade early this year, Tatjana has been actively involved in promoting R for Data Science here in Serbia. Her love for teaching and the empowerment of people with knowledge for data analysis through the use of R is obvious. Through her active engagements with the local data science community initiatives such as R-Ladies Belgrade, Tatjana encourages a creative and open approach to teaching and learning and is a great advocate of diversity within the R community and STEM in general.</description>
