      <description>Since returning to Belgrade early this year, Tatjana has been actively involved in promoting R for Data Science here in Serbia. Her love for teaching and the empowerment of people with knowledge for data analysis through the use of R is obvious. Through her active engagements with the local data science community initiatives such as R-Ladies Belgrade, Tatjana encourages a creative and open approach to teaching and learning and is a great advocate of diversity within the R community and STEM in general.</description>
