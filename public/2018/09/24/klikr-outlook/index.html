      <p>The klik-R workshop couldn’t have got to a better start! 😃</p>
<p><span style="color:#1C86EE"><em>“I learned something new.”</em></span></p>

<p>Our students were amazing; they were all fired up, bursting with enthusiasm and a desire to learn about R-stats. If this is level of interest at our first workshop what will the next one be like? We’re super exited!!</p>
<p>What we learned from workshop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not everyone owns a laptop, so we need to source more equipment to make the sessions more inclusive.</li>
<li>There is a massive hunger for learning about data science using R from a wide range of age groups.</li>
<li>Pizza is always popular</li>
<li>There needs to be more focus on filling the gaps in their knowledge of basic statistical concepts.</li>
<li>The student’s commitment to the subject was evident in their desire to stay longer; they didn’t want to go home and wanted to know when we could meet again.</li>
<li>Having supportive sponsors is an invaluable part of delivering our workshops.</li>
</ul>
<p>The workshop made it clear to us that the skills needed for data analysis are not being fulfilled by traditional ‘book learning’ and a more creative hands-on approach is the way forward.</p>

<p>Our students gave us great feedback</p>
<p><span style="color:#1C86EE"><em>“I really liked what Tanja complicated things could explain so they are easy to understand and that they look simple. I’m very happy because I learned a lot. I mostly liked the part with the statistics.”</em></span></p>
<p>and were excited to attend meeting with <a href="http://hadley.nz/">Hadley Wickham</a> at the event and presentation he gave to <a href="https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-Belgrade/events/254474297/">R-Ladies Belgrade</a>.</p>

</div>
<p><span style="color:#1C86EE"> <em>“I would like to continue with this workshop because R seems useful to me from many aspects. I would like to have a workshops from time to time where we could share what we have done so far and start a new part of the work on the R.”</em></span></p>
<p>Material from the workshop is available from:</p>
