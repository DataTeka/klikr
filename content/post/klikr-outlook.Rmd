The klik-R workshop couldnâ€™t have got to a better start! ðŸ˜ƒ

<span style="color:#1C86EE">*"I learned something new."*</span>

Our students were amazing; they were all fired up, bursting with enthusiasm and a desire to learn about R-stats. If this is level of interest at our first workshop what will the next one be like? Weâ€™re super exited!!

What we learned from workshop:

* Not everyone owns a laptop, so we need to source more equipment to make the sessions more inclusive.
* There is a massive hunger for learning about data science using R from a wide range of age groups.
* Pizza is always popular
* There needs to be more focus on filling the gaps in their knowledge of basic statistical concepts.
* The studentâ€™s commitment to the subject was evident in their desire to stay longer; they didnâ€™t want to go home and wanted to know when we could meet again.
* Having supportive sponsors is an invaluable part of delivering our workshops.

The workshop made it clear to us that the skills needed for data analysis are not being fulfilled by traditional â€˜book learningâ€™ and a more creative hands-on approach is the way forward.

Our students gave us great feedback 

<span style="color:#1C86EE">*"I really liked what Tanja complicated things could explain so they are easy to understand and that they look simple. I'm very happy because I learned a lot.
I mostly liked the part with the statistics."*</span>

and were excited to attend meeting with [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) at the event and presentation he gave to [R-Ladies Belgrade](https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-Belgrade/events/254474297/).

<span style="color:#1C86EE"> *"I would like to continue with this workshop because R seems useful to me from many aspects. I would like to have a workshops from time to time where we could share what we have done so far and start a new part of the work on the R."*</span>
